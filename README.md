Note that the phones.json file contains unique ids and image urls for each of the phones. The urls point to the app/img/phones/ directory.

app/phones/phones.json (sample snippet):

[
  {
    ...
    "id": "motorola-defy-with-motoblur",
    "imageUrl": "img/phones/motorola-defy-with-motoblur.0.jpg",
    "name": "Motorola DEFY\u2122 with MOTOBLUR\u2122",
    ...
  },
  ...
]
